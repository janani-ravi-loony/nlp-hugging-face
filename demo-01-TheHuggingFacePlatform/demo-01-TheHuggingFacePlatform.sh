# In Hugging Face, Spaces are custom, shareable ML/AI web apps hosted directly on Hugging Face infrastructure. They allow you to:
# Deploy and demo machine learning models easily.
# Create interactive frontends using tools like Gradio, Streamlit, or even custom HTML/JS.
# Share your app with a simple URL, just like you would for a GitHub repo.

# Spaces annotated with "Zero" are zero-GPU spaces (they do not utilize GPUs)

### Model explanations

# BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers)
# Overview: BERT is a transformer-based model designed for natural language understanding. It processes text bidirectionally, meaning it considers both the left and right context of each word during training.

# Training Objective: BERT is trained using two objectives: (1) Masked Language Modeling (MLM), where random words in a sentence are masked and the model predicts them, and (2) Next Sentence Prediction (NSP), where the model predicts if two sentences follow each other in the text.

# Strengths: BERT’s bidirectional approach allows it to capture context more effectively than unidirectional models, making it powerful for tasks like question answering, sentiment analysis, and named entity recognition.

# RoBERTa (A Robustly Optimized BERT Pretraining Approach)

# Overview: RoBERTa builds on BERT by optimizing the training process and removing some of the limitations of the original BERT model. It focuses on improving the pretraining phase to create a more robust model.

# Key Improvements:
# More Training Data: RoBERTa is trained on a much larger dataset compared to BERT.
# Longer Training: RoBERTa is trained for more steps, allowing it to learn better representations.
# No NSP: RoBERTa removes the Next Sentence Prediction objective, focusing solely on the MLM task.
# Dynamic Masking: The masking pattern is changed during each epoch to prevent the model from seeing the same masked tokens multiple times.

# DistilRoBERTa

# Overview: DistilRoBERTa is a distilled version of the RoBERTa model, meaning it’s a smaller and faster model designed to retain most of RoBERTa’s performance while being more efficient.
# Distillation Process: This model is created using knowledge distillation, where a smaller model (the student) is trained to replicate the behavior of a larger model (the teacher, in this case, RoBERTa). The student model learns to predict the outputs of the teacher model, rather than learning directly from the training data.
# Strengths: DistilRoBERTa is approximately 60% faster than RoBERTa and uses less memory, making it ideal for deployment in resource-constrained environments while still achieving competitive performance on many tasks.
